# Kulaldastot

You have arrived. After a journey from the Mountainhomes into the forbidding wilderness beyond, your harsh trek has finally ended. Your party of seven is to make an outpost for the glory of all of TÃ¶rasonol.

There are almost no supplies left, but with stout labor comes sustenance. Whether by bold, plow or hook, provide for your dwarves. You are expecting a supply caravan just before winter entombs you, but it is Spring now. Enough time to delve secure lodgings, ere the jaguar men get hungry. A new chapter of dwarven history begins at this place, Kulaldastot, "Wondersword". Strike the earth!

1. ## Ice, 15th Granite
  - **Spring #250**
  - We have five [River Otters](#wiki-river_otter), one [Sea Lamprey](#wiki-sea_lamprey) and one [Giant Sponge](#wiki-giant_sponge) as neightborns.
  - Examining the features of our terrain, I see we will have to dig down to create the fortress entrance :c
  - The river has a *very characteristic* path, plus a pocket-sized waterfall.
